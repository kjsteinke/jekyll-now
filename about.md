I was born to an entrepreneurial father and an opera singing mother. I attended Capistrano Valley High School where I played football; but as soon as I was able to drive, I spent my mornings surfing at Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point (it was actually a P.E. class) and weekends surfing in San Clemente. I attended Cal State University Fullerton; where I graduated with a degree in Information Systems.
