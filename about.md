I was born to an entrepreneurial father and an opera singing mother in Torrance, CA. We lived in Palos Verdes CA, Irvine, CA and eventually spent 20+ years in San Juan Capistrano, CA. I attended Capistrano Valley High School where I played football; but as soon as I was able to drive, I spent my mornings surfing at Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point (it was actually a P.E. class) and weekends surfing in San Clemente. After High School, I attended Saddleback College, San Diego State University and eventually I decided to work during the day and attend night classes at Cal State University Fullerton; where I graduated with a degree in Management Information Systems and entered the world of computer programming!
